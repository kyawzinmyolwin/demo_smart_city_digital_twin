# Provider + remote state configuration.
#
# WHY A REMOTE BACKEND?
# Terraform records what it created in a "state" file. Keeping that state in S3
# (with a DynamoDB lock) instead of on your laptop means it survives a lost
# machine and prevents two applies from clobbering each other. The state bucket
# and lock table must already exist BEFORE `terraform init` — see infra/README.md
# (they are created by hand once; Terraform cannot bootstrap its own backend).
#
# The backend block is intentionally EMPTY here (partial configuration). Real
# values come from backend.hcl at init time:
#     terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
# That keeps account-specific bucket names out of version control.

  backend "s3" {}
