"""
Per-tick traffic metrics, computed from one emitter snapshot.

``compute_tick_metrics`` is a pure function: dict in, dict out, no I/O and no
third-party imports. That means it is unit-testable with plain dicts and no
InfluxDB / SUMO / network — and the exact same function becomes the body of the
future ``traffic-metrics`` Lambda (see infra/). metrics_writer.py wraps it with
a WebSocket client and an InfluxDB writer.
