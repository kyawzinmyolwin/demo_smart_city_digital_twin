# SUMO producer image — runs run_traci.py --emit (the simulation + WebSocket emitter).
#
# SUMO isn't pip-installable at this project's version, so the image installs it
# from the official PPA. This is the SAME recipe infra/sim_host.tf uses on EC2,
# which is verified to load this repo's net/demand files — so the PPA's SUMO
# version is known-good for them.
#
# The code + data are NOT baked in (the 2D_simulation tree is ~0.6 GB); they are
# bind-mounted at /app by docker-compose.yml. The image carries only the runtime:
# SUMO, sumo-tools (sumolib + traci), and the emitter's Python deps.
